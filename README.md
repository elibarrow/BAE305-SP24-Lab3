## Summary of Lab ##

## Lab Assignment Specific Items ##

### Objective 1: Learn to use Diodes, LEDs, and transistors in a basic circuit ###

## Part 1 - LED Driving Circuits ##

 The first 2 questions of Part 1 of this lab was based on the circuit in the picture shown below.

  FIGURE 3 PICTURE HERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

**Step 1**   
We began by measuring the true values of the resistors and comparing them to the expected resistance using the Fluke 87 Digital Multimeter. 

 |Resistor (Expected Value)| Actual Value |
|---|---|
|270   &Omega;|  269.30   &Omega;  |
|1  k&Omega;|  985   &Omega;  |
|2.2   &Omega;|  2.5   &Omega;  |

**Step 2**  
After building the circuit and varifying the resistor values, we then measured the voltages at each test point that is shown on the schematic above. We were then given the table below and filled it out with the values that we measured in the lab. 

 |Test Point| Voltage (Switch On)| Voltage Switch (Off) |
|---|---|---|
|T1|  4.989 V | 4.991 V|
|T2| 1.902 V  |1.902 V|
|T3|  0.008 V | 3.690 V |
|T4|  0.000 V | 0.000 V|
|**Component**| **Voltage (Switch On)**| **Voltage Switch (Off)**|
|R1|  3.089 V  | 0.000 V |
|LED1|  1.893 V  | 0.150 V|
|S1|  0.000 V  | 0.000 V|
||  **Current Through (Switch On)** |**Current Through (Switch Off) **|
|LED1|  10.010 mA  | 0.010 mA|  


*Figure 2

In step 2 we were also asked to calculate the current through R1 by using Ohm's law. When using V=IR, where V = 5V, R = 270&Omega;, I = ?. We found the current (I) through R1 to be equal to 18.518 mA.
